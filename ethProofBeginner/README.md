# DaveCoin Token Project
This is a simple cryptocurrency
easy to use for all
easy to make as beginner dev too

## Description
daveCoin is a cryptocurrency token that can be deployed to ethereum

for simplicity:
davecoins can be created by anyone
davecoins can be destroyed by anyone
davecoins cannot be transferred

## Getting Started

copy daveCoin.sol into the remix ide website (copy the contents into a .sol file on remix)
select the appropriate compiler version in the  remix ide compiler
compile the contract

### Installing
once you have compiled daveCoin.sol successfully, it can be deployed to the ethereum mainnet (expensive) or testnets

you can also test the code in the remix vm

you can do all of this in the remix ide deployer

select the deployment environment as injected provider if you want to deploy to mainnet or testnet

### Executing program

following deployment, you can interact with the daveCoin contract within the remix ide deployer

you can call the mint (creates daveCoins) and burn (destroys daveCoins) functions  with an address and a value (tokens to be created or destroyed)

you can also check the total supply, balance of an address (with address as input) and the tokenName and abbreviation


## Help

improvements need to be made to the davecoin contract to make sure only the owner address can mint
and  other address can only burn tokens they own
